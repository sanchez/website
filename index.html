                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        I enjoy coding microcontrollers and have recently looked into coding on modern web-based platforms, through nodejs and sass. I have a strong understanding of C and C++. In 2016 I was a video editor and producer for a couple of promotional videos at Emmanuel College and in the same year was head of the Emmanuel Rugby 7s IT.

                        <h3>Hermes <span class="badge white-text">Development</span></h3>
                            Hermes is a nodejs application for converting markdown to pdf, or latex. The main goal of the project is to allow users to easily extend an existing template and create their own. It is also hoped that in the future, this program will write directly to pdf, allowing users with more flexibility in the way that data is handled and presented.

                        <h3>Titan <span class="badge white-text">Planning</span></h3>
                            The lightweight text editor, with a beast under the hood. There isn't a lot of text editors out there that are lightweight and allow plugins and extensions (apart from vim). The idea behind Titan is to be as lightweight, and extendable as vim or neovim, but be built on nodejs and provide beautiful and easy to understand documentation and API.

                        <h3>LaTeX Libraries <span class="badge white-text">Active</span></h3>
                            A number of LaTeX libraries were written to help people who like my style of documents easily create their own in similar format. These libraries are easily applied and modified, all accessible through GitHub.

                        <h3>Emmanuel International Rugby 7s <span class="badge white-text">Removed</span></h3>
                            The main page for the Emmanuel 7s competition, with admin page to allow people to update scores and game times. This site was the goto place for the event volunteers and event participants, allowing them to get lightning fast update and results for different games, all from a glance. Sadly this page had to be taken down after the competition for technical reasons.

                            Part of a two man team to great a website for the Studio Pierrot Company. The website was an attempt to get a bigger audience for the company. And used the common web design theory, parallex scrolling.
